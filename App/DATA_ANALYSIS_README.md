# Data Analysis Tab Documentation

## 📊 New Feature: AI-Powered Dataset Analysis

The **Data Analysis** tab provides an interactive environment for GPU-accelerated data analysis with AI assistance.

### How it Works:

1. **📁 Dataset Selection**: Choose from sample datasets or upload your own CSV file
2. **🤖 AI Analysis**: Get intelligent suggestions for GPU-accelerated operations 
3. **💻 Code Generation**: AI creates optimized GPU code for your chosen analysis
4. **🚀 Execution**: Run the code on our Sol computing cluster with GPU acceleration
5. **📈 Results**: View execution output, performance metrics, and generated plots

### Key Features:

- **Smart Suggestions**: AI analyzes your dataset structure and suggests relevant operations
- **GPU Optimization**: All generated code uses RAPIDS libraries (cuDF, cuML, CuPy)
- **Visual Output**: Plots and visualizations are displayed inline
- **Performance Tracking**: Execution time and job details are provided
- **Educational**: Each generated code includes explanations of GPU techniques used

### Sample Datasets Included:

- `employee_sample.csv` - Employee data for HR analytics and clustering

### Technical Implementation:

- **Job Execution**: Uses SLURM job submission to Sol cluster
- **GPU Libraries**: cuDF, cuML, CuPy, RAPIDS ecosystem
- **AI Integration**: RAG agent provides dataset analysis and code generation
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib plots encoded and displayed in interface

### Usage Tips:

1. Start with a sample dataset to understand the workflow
2. Let the AI analyze your data before choosing an operation
3. Review the generated code and explanation to learn GPU techniques
4. Monitor execution time to see GPU acceleration benefits

This feature bridges the gap between learning about GPU acceleration and actually applying it to real datasets!
